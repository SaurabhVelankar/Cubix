# Cubix
This is a simple and fun game developed by me for learning purpose and it's my first ever game made!
To play the game go to Builds/Windows/x86_64/CUBIX!!.exe
For now the game does not have a pause menu so you may have to force quit,but will update soon.
I'm still a beginner and a newbie in game development so sorry for the inconvinience.
But still you will enjoy the game.
